# Voter's Revenge
Voter's Revenge is an open source software project, which will construct a tool useful for building up populist political muscle. It is designed to exploit the particulars of the American election system as well as optimize types of activism, according to where the electorate is in an election cycle, so as not to waste time and energy attempting forms of activism that experience proves are practically useless. It's github home, where this sub-project and a few others will eventually be integrated, is [sldev2/votersrevenge](https://github.com/sldev2/votersrevenge) . It is expected that the tool will also prove useful in non-US democracies. 

[sldev2/votersrevenge](https://github.com/sldev2/votersrevenge) lists all of the consituent sub-projects, including votersrevenge-frontend. 

Voter's Revenge has an informational wordpress site: [votersrevenge.info](https://www.votersrevenge.info/)
